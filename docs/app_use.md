-- Application Use and Motivation --

In traditional educational settings, the difficulty of an exam paper is
understood only after the exam has been conducted, typically by analyzing
student average scores or pass percentages. This reactive approach limits an
instructor’s ability to design balanced assessments beforehand.

The proposed system introduces a predictive approach to exam analysis.

By leveraging machine learning models trained on historical question data,
the system can estimate the difficulty of exam questions even before the
exam is conducted. This prediction is based on the textual characteristics
of questions and learned patterns, making it independent of current student
performance data.

Key advantages of the system include:
- Pre-exam difficulty prediction without requiring student scores
- Support for exam paper design and validation
- Reduction of reliance on post-exam score-based analysis
- Ability to flag potentially difficult or ambiguous questions in advance

While student performance data can enhance post-exam analytics, the core
predictive capability of the system operates independently of student scores,
distinguishing it from traditional evaluation methods.
